# Batting-position-analysis-IPL-team
Through this ananlysis one can understand why RCB is not winning IPL. From the output graph it is clear that RCB is dependent on their top order. No low order batsmen scored above
600 runs in all IPL seasons, whereas if we see the teams like CSK and MI they don't depend on specific order batsmen. Their all batsmen are performing good. They have very batting 
depth. IPL is batsmen's game.So they are super consistent in IPL. Together they have won 9 IPL trophies.
